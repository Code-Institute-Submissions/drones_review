Code Institute Milestone Project:

Drone Review Site 

Goal: Build a drone review and recommendation site.

External user's goal:Find drone they would like to buy.

Site owner's goal:Earn money on each drone purchased via a link from the site.

Potential features to include:
Create a web application that allows users to upload details of drones, including drone name, brand name, link to cover image and any other relevant fields. 
Allow users to write comments about any drone and upvote it.
Create the backend code and frontend form(s) to allow users to add new drone brands and reviews to the site, edit them and delete them.
