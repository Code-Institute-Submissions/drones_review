# Code Institute Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development

# Drone Review Site

---

Drones are no longer just a hobby but are increasingly a job of the future. With a drone, you can do almost anything, make movies, do delivery, shoot commercials, access inaccessible terrain, monitor fire-prone areas, save lives, and much, much more.
On this page you can find the top 9 drones in 2020. You can read the specifications, watch the videos, buy, and most importantly read the reviews, add a review to help people choose the best one either for business or for a hobby.
